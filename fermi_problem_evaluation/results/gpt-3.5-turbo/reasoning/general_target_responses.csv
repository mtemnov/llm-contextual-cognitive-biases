Answer: 10,800 liters"
37,8,gpt-3.5-turbo,gpt-4-turbo,simple,general,reasoning,increase,"Reasoning: 
1. An average adult breathes approximately 12-20 times per minute at rest.
2. The average volume of air inhaled and exhaled during each breath at rest is about 0.5 liters.
3. Therefore, the average adult breathes about 6-10 liters of air per minute at rest.
4. In one day (24 hours), an average adult would breathe approximately:
   - 6 liters/min * 60 min/hour * 24 hours = 8,640 liters (minimum estimate)
   - 10 liters/min * 60 min/hour * 24 hours = 14,400 liters (maximum estimate)

Answer: 
An average person breathes approximately between 8,640 to 14,400 liters of air in one day."
37,9,gpt-3.5-turbo,gpt-4-turbo,simple,general,reasoning,increase,"Reasoning: 
1. An average adult breathes about 12-20 times per minute at rest. 
2. Let's assume an average of 15 breaths per minute.
3. This equals 900 breaths per hour (15 breaths/minute x 60 minutes).
4. Assuming the average adult breathes at a volume of 0.5 liters per breath, they would inhale 450 liters of air per hour (900 breaths x 0.5 liters).
5. Over a 24-hour period, the total volume of air breathed in would be 10,800 liters (450 liters/hour x 24 hours).
