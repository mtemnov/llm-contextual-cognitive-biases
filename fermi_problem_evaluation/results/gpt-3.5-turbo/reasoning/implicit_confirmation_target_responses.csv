1. According to research, an average mature tree can absorb about 48 pounds of carbon per year through photosynthesis, which is converted into new wood growth.
2. Considering that trees grow throughout the year, we can estimate that on average, a tree grows about 48/365 = 0.1315 pounds of new wood per day.
3. The total number of trees worldwide is estimated to be around 3 trillion.
4. Multiplying the average daily growth of a tree by the total number of trees gives us the total mass of new wood grown daily globally.

Answer: 3 trillion trees * 0.1315 pounds/day = 394.5 billion pounds/day."
