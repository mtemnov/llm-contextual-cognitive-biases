2. Assuming an average lifespan of around 70 years for a mother, we can estimate the number of mothers who are currently alive as approximately 7.9 billion divided by 70, which is around 113 million.
3. If we assume that the average number of mothers alive at any point in history (taking into account population growth over time) is around 100 million, we can estimate the total number of human mothers who have ever lived by multiplying this average by the number of years modern humans have existed on Earth.
4. Modern humans have been around for roughly 200,000 years.
