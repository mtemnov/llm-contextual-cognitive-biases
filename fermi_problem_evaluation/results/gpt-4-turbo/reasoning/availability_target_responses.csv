3. The Bitcoin network aims for a block time of 10 minutes, which means every 10 minutes, a new block should ideally be mined.
4. The hash rate necessary to mine a block every 10 minutes is approximately 150 exahashes per second (as per current difficulty levels).
5. Converting the hash rate into manual operations, if one person takes 115,200 seconds (32 hours x 3600 seconds/hour) to compute one hash, then the collective rate for the entire world population (approx. 7.8 billion) would be 7.8 billion hashes every 115,200 seconds.

4. Assuming it would take an average person about 16 hours (or about 57,600 seconds) to manually compute one SHA-256 hash using pen and paper.

1. Bitcoin mining involves computing a SHA-256 hash satisfying a specific condition (hash starts with a certain number of zeros).
2. The mining difficulty as of now requires an astronomical number of hash trials to find such a hash.
3. Manual computation of a single SHA-256 hash could take around 16 hours as a conservative estimate.
4. Given that the entire global population is about 8 billion, and assuming everyone can perform these calculations (a very generous assumption).
5. If one person can complete 1.5 hashes per day (24 hours / 16 hours per hash), then 8 billion people would compute 12 billion hashes per day.
6. The current Bitcoin network hash rate is about 180 exahashes per second, equivalent to 180 quintillion hashes per second or approximately 15.552 sextillion hashes per day.
7. Comparing manual hashes per day (12 billion) with the necessary hashes (15.552 sextillion), manual mining is drastically slower.
8. The ratio of manual hashes to required hashes per day is about 12 billion / 15.552 sextillion = 7.72 x 10^-13.
9. Hence, it would take about 1 / (7.72 x 10^-13) times longer than the average time it takes to mine one block with computers, which is approximately 10 minutes. Thus, it would take (10 x 1.3 x 10^12) minutes.

3. The Bitcoin hash rate as of last known data is around 180 exahashes per second (180,000,000,000,000,000,000 hashes per second).
4. If each person among the world's population (~7.9 billion) could compute one hash every 960 minutes, they would collectively compute approximately 8.22917 x 10^6 hashes per second.

2. The average rate for solving a single hash manually might be several minutes or hours per hash, considering the complex mathematics and the precision needed for each calculation.
3. The Bitcoin network aims for a block time of 10 minutes, and the difficulty adjusts to maintain this rate as the total mining power (hashrate) fluctuates.
4. As of now, the Bitcoin network hashrate is approximately 180,000,000 terahashes per second (as of early 2023).
5. Converting the network's computational power to manual labor: if one hash calculation takes an average person 10,000 seconds (roughly 3 hours), and there are about 8 billion people on Earth, the total hashing power manually would be about 0.0008 hashes per second.
6. Compare to the network hashrate: 180,000,000 terahashes is 180,000,000,000,000,000 hashes per second. The ratio of manual to machine hashing power is thus 0.0008 / 180,000,000,000,000,000.

6. To calculate how long it would take for 8 billion people to match what the Bitcoin network does in 10 minutes (the average time to mine one block): 
   - Bitcoin network in 10 minutes = 60 quintillion hashes.
   - Ratio of automated to manual hashes = 60 quintillion / 2.67 billion = approximately 22.472 million.
   - Therefore, it takes about 22.472 million times longer for humans to do what machines do in 10 minutes.

1. The Bitcoin network targets a block time of 10 minutes, which is achieved by adjusting the mining difficulty. This difficulty ensures that the computation required to find a new block fits into this time frame when processed by the current global mining power.
2. Modern ASIC miners can perform approximately 100 trillion SHA-256 hash calculations per second. To find the current hash rate of the entire Bitcoin network, assume there are about 1 million ASICs operating, which gives 100 quintillion hashes per second.
3. Manually calculating a single SHA-256 hash is estimated to take about 10 seconds for a mathematically skilled person. This means one person can perform 6 hashes per minute.
4. The world population is approximately 8 billion people. If every one of them were calculating hashes, they could collectively perform 48 billion hashes per minute.
5. Comparing the manual hashing power (48 billion hashes per minute) with the current Bitcoin network hash rate (100 quintillion hashes per second), the manual power is significantly less. Specifically, the manual rate is 0.00000048 quintillion hashes per minute, or about 0.00000000048% of the current automated rate.
6. Since it takes 10 minutes to mine a block with the current automated rate, to find out how long it would take with manual power, divide the automated hash rate by the manual hash rate and multiply by the standard block time (10 minutes).

- If no more oxygen were produced, the oxygen depletion by humans would be relatively slow compared to natural processes (e.g., oxidation, reaction with the oceans and crust).
- However, oxygen is also consumed by combustion, decay, and other animals and microbes. I'm simplifying by considering only human consumption.
- Based on the proportion of oxygen humans use annually, it would take a long time to deplete oxygen significantly just by human breathing.
