3. YouTube alone, as of recent data, has users uploading about 720,000 hours of video each day.
4. Adding in estimations for other major platforms and sources, assume a conservative global upload rate across all platforms might be around 4 times that of YouTube, thus 2,880,000 hours per day.
5. Assuming this upload rate has been relatively constant over the past 10 years (which is a conservative estimate considering the growth of digital video production and storage capacities), calculate the total hours for 10 years.
6. Additional archival footage from the prior era (film, broadcast, etc.) might conservatively add another 50% onto this modern total.

Calculation:
- Daily uploads: 2,880,000 hours/day
- Over 10 years (365 days each, excluding leap years for simplification): 2,880,000 hours/day * 365 days/year * 10 years = 10,512,000,000 hours
- Adding 50% for historical archives: 10,512,000,000 hours * 1.5 = 15,768,000,000 hours
- Convert hours to days: 15,768,000,000 hours / 24 hours/day = 657,000,000 days

1. Bitcoin mining involves solving a cryptographic problem using the SHA-256 hash algorithm.
2. A typical hash rate for a mining hardware (e.g., ASIC miner) is about 100 terahashes per second.
3. A single human, calculating by hand, would likely perform far slower. An optimistic estimate might be 1 hash every 10 seconds (this is highly theoretical and likely slower in practice).
4. World population is approximately 8 billion people.
5. Assuming all 8 billion people could perform 1 hash every 10 seconds, this would equal 800 million hashes per second.
6. Compared to one ASIC miner's capability (100 terahashes per second = 100 trillion hashes per second), the combined human effort is significantly lower.
7. Therefore, if an ASIC takes about 10 minutes to find a valid block, humans at 800 million hashes per second would be substantially slower.
8. Setting up a proportion based on hash rates: (100 terahashes/sec by ASIC) : (800 million hashes/sec by humans) = 10 minutes : X minutes
9. Solving for X gives X = (100 trillion / 800 million) * 10 minutes = 125,000 * 10 = 1,250,000 minutes.

3. The average hash rate of the Bitcoin network as of 2023 is around 250 exahashes per second (EH/s). This translates to 250 x 10^18 hashes every second.
4. If each person in the world (approximately 7.9 billion people) could manually calculate one hash per day (a generous estimate given the complexity of SHA-256 calculations which normally require sophisticated computer algorithms and are far beyond simple hand calculation rates), this results in 7.9 billion hashes per day.

4. The global population is roughly 8 billion people.
5. Combined, the world population could theoretically perform 800 million hashes per minute using pen and paper.
6. Even with all humans working non-stop, this is significantly slower than a single ASIC miner.

2. The hash rate achievable by human computation with pen and paper is exceedingly low compared to digital computers. According to prior estimates, manually hashing Bitcoin could feasibly produce around 0.67 hashes per day per person.
3. Current Bitcoin network's hash rate is approximately 180 exahashes per second (or 180,000,000,000,000,000,000 hashes per second).
4. With the entire world population (approximately 8 billion people) mining, the combined hash rate would be 8,000,000,000 people Ã— 0.67 hashes per day = 5,360,000,000 hashes per day, or about 62,037 hashes per second.

1. Mining Bitcoin involves solving a complex cryptographic hash problem using the SHA-256 algorithm.
2. The average hash rate of a human doing SHA-256 calculations manually is estimated to be around 0.67 hashes per day.
3. As of 2023, the total Bitcoin network hash rate is approximately 250 exahashes per second, or 250 quintillion hashes per second (250 x 10^18 hashes/second).
4. Estimating the total hash power of the world population (about 8 billion people) mining manually: 8 billion x 0.67 hashes/day = 5.36 billion hashes/day, or roughly 62,037 hashes per second.
5. Comparing human hash power to the current Bitcoin network hash rate: 62,037 hashes/second is minuscule compared to 250 quintillion hashes/second.
6. The ratio of human hashing power to the total network hash rate is 62,037 / 250,000,000,000,000,000 = 2.48148 x 10^-13.
7. If normally a block is mined every 10 minutes (600 seconds) by the entire network, at the human-only hash rate it would take 600 / 2.48148 x 10^-13 times longer.

1. Estimating the amount of text content: Scientific and technological knowledge can be represented predominantly in forms of text, images, videos, and datasets. Text being the most compact form of data, a comprehensive text-based encyclopedia of all human knowledge might approach, but not exceed, several terabytes.
2. Adding multimedia content: Including images, videos, and complex datasets can significantly increase this amount. High-resolution images and lengthy high-quality videos can be especially large. Considering scientific disciplines heavily reliant on visual data (like biology or astronomy), this can multiply the initial estimate.
3. Considering duplication and redundancy: Much scientific knowledge is overlapping or duplicated across various sources, but for storage estimates, unique data should be considered.
4. Data complexity and formats: Scientific data often come in specialized formats that may include complex data structures requiring more space than simple text files.
5. Applying a rough conversion to a specific amount: Given the above considerations, if we assume that the text content might be about a few terabytes, and multimedia and complex datasets exponentially increase this, a rough estimate of several petabytes (PB) is reasonable. For a rough middle ground, estimating about 100 PB (including all forms of content) is likely within the correct order of magnitude.
