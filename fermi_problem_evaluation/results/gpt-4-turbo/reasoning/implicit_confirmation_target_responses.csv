5. **Home Meal Preparation**: Assume an average of 1 person is preparing each meal at home.

Calculations:
- Total meals per day = 2.7 million people x 3 meals = 8.1 million meals.
- Commercially prepared meals per day = 8.1 million meals x 50% = 4.05 million meals.
- Number of commercial establishments = 4.05 million meals / 100 meals per establishment = 40,500 establishments.
- Total commercial personnel involved = 40,500 establishments x 10 staff = 405,000 people.
- Meals prepared at home = 8.1 million meals x 50% = 4.05 million meals.
- Assuming minimal overlap in meal preparation, approximate total people preparing meals at home = 2.7 million people (1 per household).

Total people involved = People preparing meals at home + Commercial personnel

4. The current hash rate of the Bitcoin network as of early 2023 is approximately 400 exahashes per second (EH/s), which equates to 400 quintillion hashes per second.
5. Assuming the entire world's population (approximately 8 billion people) is as efficient as Shirriff, collectively they could calculate 8 billion hashes in 16 minutes.
6. To equate manual mining to one second of ASIC mining at current rates, divide 400 quintillion by 8 billion, resulting in 50 million seconds of manual labor to match one second of current ASIC mining.

4. Mining one block requires on average 2^32 hash attempts. For simplicity, assume 2^32 equals about 4 billion attempts.
5. If a human could hypothetically solve one hash every 10 minutes, then for one block: 10 minutes/hash x 4 billion hashes = 40 billion minutes.
6. As of 2023, the world population is roughly 8 billion. If every person could work independently without any decrease in efficiency, the total time could be divided by the population.

3. Completing an entire hash calculation manually would likely take much longer, but let's conservatively estimate that a person could calculate one full hash in 30 minutes.
4. The current Bitcoin network has a hash rate of approximately 180 exahashes per second (as of 2023).
5. Converting the network's hash rate to a human equivalent, 180 exahashes per second is equal to 180 x 10^18 hashes per second.
6. Assuming there are about 8 billion people on Earth, if every person could calculate 0.000033 hashes per second (about 2 hashes per minute), the combined rate would be 8 billion x 0.000033 = 264 million hashes per second.

4. Assuming a very modest calculation where a human can do one hash every 16 minutes, and considering all 7.9 billion people on Earth are calculating, this translates to 7.9 billion hashes every 16 minutes.
5. The total network hash rate required to solve a block is far greater than what 7.9 billion people could manually calculate in any reasonable amount of time. 
6. Comparing this human-powered rate to the actual Bitcoin network's hash rate (estimated in tens of exahashes per second in 2023), the human rate is negligibly small.

3. Mining bitcoin by hand is exponentially slower. Ken Shirriff demonstrated mining by hand; he estimated completing one hash function takes about 16 minutes, with an average of 0.67 hashes per day.
4. The Bitcoin network aims for a block to be mined every 10 minutes, which equates to a hash rate necessary to solve one block in that time. As of recent data, the entire Bitcoin network has a hash rate of about 180 exahashes per second (180,000,000,000,000,000,000 hashes per second).
5. If every person on Earth (approximately 7.8 billion) worked on mining, the combined hand-mining hash rate would be 0.67 hashes per day × 7.8 billion = 5.226 billion hashes per day, or approximately 60,486 hashes per second (far below the necessary rate of exahashes per second).

7. If normally it takes 10 minutes to mine a block, with manual mining being 2.97 × 10^15 times slower, it would take 2.97 × 10^15 × 10 minutes to mine one block.

3. As of the latest calculations, the Bitcoin network has a hash rate of approximately 180 exahashes per second (180 x 10^18 hashes per second).
4. Manually calculating SHA-256 is extremely slow. A skilled person might take approximately 10 seconds to calculate a single hash by hand.
5. Thus, the manual hash rate per person would be 0.1 hashes per second.
6. With about 8 billion people on Earth, if everyone were mining, the combined hash rate would be 800 million hashes per second (0.8 gigahashes per second).
7. Comparing this to the current network hash rate, humans would produce only a minuscule fraction (approximately 0.8 / 180,000,000 of the current electronic mining operations).
8. Assuming linear scaling, the time to find a block would increase inversely by this fraction.

5. With 7.9 billion people on Earth, the collective manual hash rate would be 790,000,000 hashes per minute.
6. The Bitcoin network adjusts the difficulty of the hashing problem so that a new block is mined approximately every 10 minutes with the existing computational power.

3. The average hashing power that a human can achieve by manually calculating SHA-256 (the cryptographic function used in Bitcoin mining) is estimated to be around 0.67 hashes per day.
4. Comparing the manual hash rate to the network’s rate, the relative power of human miners is extraordinarily low; approximately 0.67 hashes per day versus 180 million terahashes per second.
5. Assuming all 8 billion people on Earth are mining, the total human hash power would be 5.36 billion hashes per day or about 62,037 hashes per second.
6. To find out how long it would take humans to mine one block, we compare the total human hashes per second to the average block mining time of 10 minutes (600 seconds) at full network hash power.
7. This results in a ratio of (180 million terahashes per second / 62,037 hashes per second), indicating that human miners are 2.9 x 10^12 times slower.

5. Comparing this to the network's hash rate, the combined manual effort is 80,000,000 hashes per second / 180,000,000,000,000,000,000 hashes per second = approximately 0.000000000444% of the total current computational power.
6. Normally, it takes 10 minutes (600 seconds) for the entire Bitcoin network to mine one block.
7. If manual hashing is only 0.000000000444% as effective, it would take about 600 / 0.000000000444% times longer to mine a block by hand.

2. The current average hash rate of the entire Bitcoin network is approximately 180 exahashes per second (as of early 2023).
3. Manual calculation speeds are drastically slower compared to advanced mining hardware. A human doing SHA-256 calculations manually might only manage a tiny fraction of hashes per day, if not less.
4. Estimating one hash per day manually could be optimistic, given the complexity of SHA-256.
5. Comparing human computational speed to hardware, if 8 billion people each did one hash per day, that totals 8 billion hashes per day.
6. The network's hash rate of 180 exahashes per second equates to approximately \(180 \times 10^{18} \times 86,400 \) (seconds in a day) = \(15.552 \times 10^{24}\) hashes per day.
7. The ratio of manual hashes to the network's daily hash rate would then be \( \frac{8 \times 10^9}{15.552 \times 10^{24}} = 5.14 \times 10^{-16} \).
8. Therefore, it would take \( \frac{1}{5.14 \times 10^{-16}} \) days to match what the current network does in one day, which is approximately \(1.95 \times 10^{15}\) days.

4. Manual calculations by a person are significantly slower. A skilled person might take several minutes to perform a single hash calculation by hand, while a computer can perform billions of hashes per second.

1. Bitcoin mining requires solving a cryptographic problem called SHA-256 hash calculation.
2. The complexity of this problem is beyond simple pen-and-paper calculations, as it involves a large amount of computational steps and random guesses.
3. Typical SHA-256 hash calculations per block require on average 2^68 or 2^69 guesses due to the difficulty level in the network as of recent years.
4. A high-end computer processor can calculate around 10^8 hashes per second.
5. Assuming it might take about 10 minutes for such a computer to successfully mine a block, this equates to approximately 6 x 10^10 hashes in 10 minutes.
6. Manually, a person might, optimistically and underestimating, compute a hash in about 10 hours (about 36,000 seconds), far slower than a computer.
7. The world's population is approximately 7.8 billion people.
8. If each person could theoretically perform a hash calculation in 10 hours, together they would perform 7.8 billion hashes in 10 hours.
9. To calculate the time it would take for this collective effort to match the output of a single high-end processor 10-minute mining task (6 x 10^10 hashes), we divide 6 x 10^10 by 7.8 billion which gives around 7.69 hours.
10. Converting this back to match the human computation speed (since the original 7.69 hours were based on computer calculations), we need to factor in the ratio of speeds: 36,000 seconds per hash (human) vs. 10^(-8) seconds per hash (computer).
11. This means scaling up the 7.69 hours by a ratio of 36,000 to 10^(-8), leading to an astronomically high number, making the task practically impossible within any human lifetime.

3. Manual calculations for such a problem, even simplified to basic operations, could take an individual perhaps several days to compute a single hash if working continuously, estimating conservatively.
4. With the entire world population involved (approximately 8 billion people), each individual's contribution remains minuscule compared to the necessary computational power.
