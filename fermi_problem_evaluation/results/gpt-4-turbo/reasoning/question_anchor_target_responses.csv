2. Assuming each generation is around 25-30 years, and taking a conservative estimate of 25 years, it would imply there have been many generations since the emergence of Homo sapiens, around 200,000 years ago.
3. This would be roughly 8000 generations.
4. If each generation on average half the population consists of women, and a significant portion of these women became mothers (especially considering historical societal structures), a rough conservative estimate of mothers per generation might be around 50% of the female population.
5. With 108 billion people have lived and about half of them being women, that's 54 billion women.

- YouTube users alone upload over 500 hours of video every minute (as of recent reports).
- Multiplying 500 hours by the number of minutes in a day (1440), equals 720,000 hours of new video per day on YouTube.
- Considering other major platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok likely contribute similarly large figures, the daily upload rate could reasonably be estimated at double the YouTube figure, bringing it to approximately 1,440,000 hours per day globally.
- Factoring in decades of television content, movies, and vast amounts of CCTV footage, the cumulative video footage existing in the world would add significantly to this daily rate.
- Even a conservative estimate considering the exponential growth of digital media and historical archives over the last 30 years, would suggest a total running time far exceeding the daily upload rate accumulated over multiple decades.

1. Bitcoin mining involves finding a hash that starts with a certain number of zeros, which is currently computationally intensive.
2. The average Bitcoin hash rate as of recent data is about 180 exahashes per second (180,000,000,000,000,000,000 hashes per second).
3. A highly skilled person might be able to compute a hash manually at a rate of about 1 hash every 10 seconds, requiring straightforward arithmetic which is very optimistic.
4. The world’s population is approximately 8 billion people. If every one of them performs hash calculations manually:
   - Total manual hash rate = 8 billion hashes / 10 seconds = 800 million hashes per second.
5. Comparing manual mining to the current overall Bitcoin network:
   - Manual mining is about 180 exahashes / 800 million hashes = 225,000 times slower.
6. The average time to mine a Bitcoin block intended by design is 10 minutes, or every 600 seconds.

4. The total hash rate of the Bitcoin network as of now is approximately 180 exahashes per second (180,000,000 trillion hashes per second).
5. Assuming optimistically that each person among the 8 billion people on Earth could manually calculate one hash per day, the combined global manual hash rate would be 8 billion hashes per day.
6. Compare the manual rate (8 billion hashes per day) with the current Bitcoin network rate (180,000,000 trillion hashes per second) to see how long it would take to match what the network does in one second. The ratio of the network's daily hash rate to the manual daily hash rate is approximately \(180,000,000 \times 10^{12} \times 86400 \div 8 \times 10^9 \approx 1.944 \times 10^{21}\).

4. If every person on Earth (approximately 8 billion people) were solving hashes manually at a rate of 0.67 hashes per day, the combined total would be about 5.36 billion hashes per day.

4. The world population is approximately 8 billion. Assuming everyone is capable of computing and contributing equally, 8 billion hashes could be attempted every 10 minutes.
5. Comparing this to computational speeds: 8 billion hashes/10 minutes = 800 million hashes/minute.

8. Given that the network's hash rate is orders of magnitude higher than this combined manual effort, the time required to find the correct hash manually would still be astronomically high, likely in the range of millions of years, even with all humans working non-stop.

1. Bitcoin mining requires finding a hash smaller than a target, which involves calculating SHA-256 hashes.
2. The Bitcoin network aims for a block time of 10 minutes, which is achievable with the current global hash rate of approximately 220 exahashes per second (220,000,000,000,000,000,000 hashes per second).
3. Manual calculation of a single SHA-256 hash is extremely slow. A skilled person might take several days to manually compute one hash.
4. Assuming optimistically that the entire world population of about 8 billion people could each compute one hash in three days, this would total 8 billion hashes every three days.
5. Converting this to a hash rate, 8 billion hashes in 259200 seconds (3 days) equals approximately 30,864 hashes per second.
6. Comparing this to the current machine-based hash rate of 220 exahashes per second, the manual method is about 7.13 × 10^15 times slower.
7. If normally a block is mined every 10 minutes (600 seconds), at this slower rate, it would take 7.13 × 10^15 times longer than 600 seconds to mine a block manually.

1. The Bitcoin network targets a block time of 10 minutes, which means that on average, the entire network computes enough hashes to mine a block every 10 minutes.
2. Bitcoin mining requires finding a hash that is lower than a specific target, which as of today, involves an immense amount of computational power typically provided by ASIC miners.
3. Each Bitcoin hash attempt is essentially a trial at finding a valid block and involves a double SHA-256 hashing.
4. Human calculation of SHA-256 is tremendously slow. Based on a rough estimate, if a skilled person can manually perform one hash in 10 minutes, they can do about 6 hashes per hour.
5. The Bitcoin hash rate as of now is approximately 180 exahashes per second, or 180 quintillion hashes per second.
6. Converting human hashing capacity to equivalent machine output: if 7 billion people can each do 6 hashes per hour, they would collectively perform 42 billion hashes per hour.
7. Comparing human output to current network hash rate: 42 billion hashes per hour vs. 180 quintillion hashes per second. Even if all humans worked non-stop, the fraction of the total network hash rate they would contribute is minuscule.
8. Assuming that the world’s population could somehow match the current minimum computing requirement and noting the incredible disparity in hashing capability, the time it would take for the human population to mine one block can be calculated as the ratio of total network power to human power multiplied by the normal block time of 10 minutes.

1. Bitcoin mining involves SHA-256 hashing.
2. Each hash attempt is computationally intensive, requiring multiple complex mathematical operations.
3. The average computing power globally dedicated to Bitcoin mining is approximately 180 exahashes per second.
4. Manually, one person might compute a very simple hash function a few times per day, but SHA-256 hashing at this level is likely unachievable.
5. Assuming generously that each of the 8 billion people could manually attempt one hash per day, it equates to 8 billion hashes per day.
6. Compared to the necessary exahashes (1 exahash = 10^18 hashes), this human effort is negligible.
7. The Bitcoin network aims for a block time of 10 minutes, which implies the necessity for these 180 exahashes in 10 minutes, or approximately 1080 exahashes per hour.
8. At 8 billion hashes per day, divided into the rate of 1080 exahashes per hour, we find an enormously disproportionate scale.

1. Bitcoin mining is based on solving a cryptographic hash function, specifically SHA-256, which requires significant computational power.
2. To mine a Bitcoin block, miners must find a hash value below a specific target set by the network’s difficulty level, which adjusts every 2016 blocks.
3. The average hash rate of a person doing calculations manually (estimating an extremely simplified and enormously optimistic 1 hash per 10 seconds, considering mathematical skills and speed) would be around 0.1 hashes per second.
4. The global population is approximately 7.8 billion people.
5. Combined hash rate = 0.1 hash/second/person × 7.8 billion = 780 million hashes per second.
6. The current Bitcoin network hash rate is around 180 exahashes per second, or 180 quintillion hashes per second (as of 2021).
7. Comparing the combined manual hash rate to the actual required hash rate: 780 million hashes per second is vastly insufficient compared to 180 quintillion hashes per second.
8. Estimating how long it would take with a manual hash rate to match one second of computational mining: (180 quintillion) / (780 million) = approximately 230,769,231 seconds.
9. Converting the time to mine one computational second's worth of Bitcoin into minutes for the entire manual effort: (230,769,231 seconds) / 60 = 3,846,154 minutes.

1. Current Bitcoin hash rate is approximately 200 exahashes per second (200,000,000,000,000,000,000 hashes per second).
2. Manually, a person might compute a hash in a few hours, but let's optimistically assume one person can compute one hash in 10 hours.
3. World population is roughly 8 billion people.
4. Combined, 8 billion people could theoretically compute 800 million hashes in 10 hours.
5. Converting hash rate to hashes per 10 hours: 200 exahashes/sec = 200 quintillion hashes/sec x 36,000 seconds = 7.2 quintillion hashes per 10 hours.
6. To reach the equivalent of one 10-hour mining session at current electronic speeds: 7.2 quintillion / 800 million = 9 million such 10-hour sessions needed.
7. Total time in hours = 9 million sessions x 10 hours = 90 million hours.

3. Manual calculations for Bitcoin mining involve computing SHA-256 hashes. Assuming an extremely skilled person can compute one hash in 10 seconds (a very generous assumption), they would compute 6 hashes per minute.
4. World population is approximately 8 billion people. If every person could compute 6 hashes per minute, the world as a whole could compute 48 billion hashes per minute.
5. Comparing the world’s manual hash rate (48 billion hashes per minute) to the network's automated hash rate (180 exahashes per second, or 10.8 quadrillion hashes per minute), manual mining is vastly slower.
6. The ratio of manual to automatic mining rates is roughly 1 to 225,000,000.
