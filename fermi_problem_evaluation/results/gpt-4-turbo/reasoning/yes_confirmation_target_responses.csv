4. This means not every birth resulted in a surviving line of descendants, so the number of unique mothers would be less than the total number of people.
5. Assuming a rough natural replacement rate where each mother has somewhat more than one child who survives to reproduce (factoring in those who had no children or whose children did not survive), a rough estimate might suggest that the count of mothers is somewhat less than the total number of people ever lived.
6. Thus, considering potential overlap and the higher historic birth rates, the number of mothers could be estimated somewhat conservatively at around 75% of the total human population that has existed.

1. Consider the total number of humans estimated to have ever lived, which is typically cited as around 107 billion.
2. Assuming each generation involves one mother per birth on average (ignoring multiple births from the same mother to simplify), and each surviving child represents a new generation or continuation of the population.
3. Population estimates account for all individuals, regardless of gender, so approximately half of this number would be female.
4. However, not all females historically had children due to various factors such as infertility, societal roles, or early death. Estimating the proportion of females who became mothers is complex, but a rough approximation might be that around 80% of women had children, reflective of historical societies where family was a central unit and childbearing was common.

1. Bitcoin mining requires solving a hash problem that meets the network-determined target.
2. The hash function used in Bitcoin mining is SHA-256, which is computationally intensive and designed for execution by computers.
3. A typical hash rate for a modern mining rig is about 100 TH/s (terahashes per second).
4. In contrast, manually calculating a single SHA-256 hash would likely take an individual several hours, if not days. Estimating conservatively, let's assume one hash per day per person.
5. The world population is approximately 8 billion people.
6. Total manual mining hash rate would then be 8 billion hashes per day (about 92,600 hashes per second, or 0.0926 TH/s).
7. The current total network hash rate is around 180,000,000 TH/s.
8. The ratio of manual hash rate to current network hash rate is approximately 0.0926 / 180,000,000 = 0.0000005144.
9. Average time to find a block at current hash rates is about 10 minutes. Thus, at the manual rate, it would scale up roughly by the inverse of our ratio: 10 minutes / 0.0000005144 = about 19,435,736 minutes.

1. Bitcoin mining involves solving a cryptographic hash function, specifically SHA-256, that is computationally intensive and requires significant processing power to find a hash below a certain target.
2. The current hashing power of the Bitcoin network is approximately 180 exahashes per second (180,000,000,000,000,000,000 hashes per second).
3. Manually, a person could perhaps perform a hash calculation extremely slowly. Estimating generously, if a person could calculate one hash every 10 seconds (which is far faster than realistically possible by hand), that would be 6 hashes per minute.
4. With around 8 billion people on Earth, if everyone were calculating hashes, it would result in 48 billion hashes per minute.
5. Comparing this to the network's rate, 48 billion hashes per minute is minuscule compared to 180 exahashes per second.
6. To find the time it would take for the entire world's population to mine one block at this rate, we look at how many minutes of world mining equates to one second of full network mining: 180,000,000,000,000,000,000 hashes per second / 48,000,000,000 hashes per minute = 3,750,000,000 minutes per network-second.
7. The average time to mine one Bitcoin block is approximately 10 minutes at full network speed. Therefore, at the human manual mining speed, it would take 10 minutes × 3,750,000,000 = 37,500,000,000 minutes.

Answer: 37500000000 minutes"
35,2,gpt-4-turbo,gpt-4-turbo,simple,explicit_confirmation,reasoning,decrease,"Reasoning:
1. The Bitcoin network aims for a block time of 10 minutes, which means every 10 minutes a new block should be mined.
2. The difficulty of the Bitcoin network as of now is set so that the computational power of all miners combined leads to a block being mined every 10 minutes. This difficulty is measured in hashes per second.
3. The average hash rate of the Bitcoin network as of 2021 is approximately 100 exahashes per second (10^20 hashes per second).
4. Manually calculating a hash involves performing SHA-256 calculations, which is extremely complex and time-consuming without electronic assistance.
5. An estimate of manual hashing is that a human might be able to perform such a calculation at a rate of perhaps one hash every 10 seconds (a very generous assumption).
6. The world population is around 8 billion people. If every person could manually calculate one hash every 10 seconds, this would amount to 800 million hashes per second (8 billion / 10).
7. To find out how many seconds it would take for the entire world population, working at this rate, to reach the computational power of the current Bitcoin network, we divide the network's hash rate by the total manual hash rate: 10^20 hashes per second / 8 * 10^8 hashes per second = 125,000 seconds.

1. Bitcoin mining involves solving a cryptographic hash problem, which requires finding a nonce such that when appended to the block of transactions, the resulting hash meets a specific condition (starts with a certain number of zeros).
2. The current difficulty level of Bitcoin requires an enormous amount of computational power, typically provided by ASICs.
3. One ASIC can achieve a hash rate of about 100 terahashes per second.
4. Doing such hashing manually is extremely slow. Let's assume, optimistically, a person could calculate one hash every 10 minutes.
5. With the global population (~7.9 billion people), if everyone calculated one hash every 10 minutes, that's 7.9 billion hashes every 10 minutes.
6. An ASIC with 100 terahashes per second does far more: 100 trillion hashes in one second; this means 60 x 10 x 100 trillion hashes in 10 minutes.
7. Even with the entire world population working non-stop, the manual hash rate would be minuscule compared to what is achievable with ASICs.
8. Given the enormous discrepancy in the hash rate, the probability of successfully mining a Bitcoin block manually by the world population is almost negligible, but not absolute zero. For a rough comparison, if one ASIC at peak efficiency might find a block approximately once every 10 years, the manual effort by the entire world might scale this time up to billions of times longer due to the much lower efficiency.

1. The Bitcoin network hash rate as of recent averages around 250 exahashes per second (250 quintillion hashes per second).
2. Manual hashing (solving hashes with pen and paper) is estimated to produce at most 0.67 hashes per day per person, which is approximately 0.00000775 hashes per second.
3. World population is roughly 8 billion people.
4. The total hash rate for all humans mining manually would be 8 billion x 0.00000775 = 62,000 hashes per second.
5. Compare human manual hash rate to current network hash rate: 62,000 hashes per second is vastly inferior to 250 quintillion hashes per second.
6. To find how much slower manual mining is: 250 quintillion / 62,000 = approximately 4,032,258,064,516.13 times slower.
7. Normal block time with current technology is roughly 10 minutes. Therefore, manual block time = 10 x 4,032,258,064,516.13 minutes.

2. The current Bitcoin network hash rate (as of late 2023) is approximately 300 exahashes per second (300,000,000,000,000,000,000 hashes per second).
3. Manually, a person might be able to perform a hash calculation extremely slowly. Assuming optimistically, a person might take a few hours to complete one hash by hand. Realistically, it would be much slower, but for calculation, let's assume one hash per 10 minutes.
4. The global population is approximately 8 billion people.
5. If each person could theoretically compute one hash every 10 minutes, the collective hash rate would be 800 million hashes every 10 minutes.
6. To find out how many 10-minute intervals it would take to reach one block's worth of hashes (at the current difficulty level requiring approximately the network's hash rate for 10 minutes), we use the ratio of the manual hash rate to the automated hash rate.
7. Manual global hash rate: 800,000,000 hashes / 10 minutes. Network hash rate: 300,000,000,000,000,000,000 hashes / 10 minutes.
8. The ratio is thus 800,000,000 / 300,000,000,000,000,000,000. Simplifying, the manual hashing effort is 1 / 375,000,000,000 of the electronic effort.

4. Assuming the entire world population (~7.8 billion people) contributes, the combined hash rate would be 0.1 * 7.8 billion = 780 million hashes per second.
5. Compare this to a moderate single ASIC miner with about 10^12 hashes per second, the entire world manually mining would still be approximately 1,282 times slower.
6. The current average time to mine a Bitcoin block with powerful ASIC miners is around 10 minutes.
7. Therefore, manually mining at 1,282 times slower would translate to about 10 minutes * 1,282 = 12,820 minutes.

1. Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm, which is computationally complex and typically requires electronic computation.
2. The average hash rate required to solve a block varies but is extremely high, typically measured in millions of terahashes per second.
3. Manual computation, such as hashing with pen and paper, is exceedingly slow. Ken Shirriff once demonstrated SHA-256 hashing by hand, which took him 16 minutes to hash just one round. A complete Bitcoin block hash would take much longer as it requires two rounds of SHA-256.
4. Assuming, optimistically, that one person can complete one hash every 30 minutes (this is a highly simplified assumption for the sake of estimation, actual rates would be much slower).
5. The global hash rate as of now is around 140 exahashes per second, which is 140 x 10^18 hashes per second. 
6. Assuming the entire world population (~7.8 billion) works on hashing, collectively achieving 7.8 billion hashes every 30 minutes (one hash per person per 30 minutes).
7. To find out how long it would take to reach one hash at the current global hash rate: (140 x 10^18) / (7.8 x 10^9 / 30 seconds) = approximately 5.385 x 10^11 seconds between successful hashes by the world population.

2. The hash rate required for this function is typically measured in hashes per second and currently requires substantial computational power.
3. Manual calculations are vastly slower than machine computations. For example, an average person might take several minutes or even hours to manually perform what a mining machine can compute in a fraction of a second.
4. Say, optimistically, a skilled person could theoretically compute one hash every 10 minutes manually.
5. The current Bitcoin network hash rate is approximately 200 exahashes per second, or 2 x 10^20 hashes per second.
6. To find how long it would take for the entire world population (approximately 8 billion people) to manually mine a block, we calculate the total hash rate if every person could theoretically complete one hash every 10 minutes:
   8,000,000,000 people / 600 seconds = approximately 13,333,333 hashes per second.
7. To match the current hash rate with manual labor, we need to know how much slower this is than the required rate:
   2 x 10^20 / 13,333,333 ≈ 1.5 x 10^13 times slower.
8. Since the average time to mine one block with full network power is about 10 minutes, the time with manual hashing would be:
   10 minutes x 1.5 x 10^13 = 1.5 x 10^14 minutes.

3. Human calculation speeds are incomparably slower than computer speeds. Assuming generously that a person can calculate one hash every 10 seconds, this is significantly slower than the billions of hashes per second calculated by mining hardware.
4. The current hash rate of the Bitcoin network is approximately 180,000,000 terahashes per second (as of early 2023).
5. Converting this rate to human terms:
   - If each person can perform 0.1 hashes per second,
   - and there are approximately 8 billion people,
   - the combined human hash rate would be 800 million hashes per second.
6. Comparing the human rate (800 million hashes/second) to the network rate (180,000,000 trillion hashes/second) shows humans could theoretically contribute a minuscule fraction of the necessary computational power (around 0.00000000444%).
7. Assuming linear scaling (which is an oversimplified assumption in this context), if a solo miner with standard hardware might expect to find one block every 100 years, humans might then expect to find one block every (100 years / 0.00000000444) = approximately 22.5225 billion years.

3. A very optimistic estimate might suggest a human could compute a hash in 10 minutes manually, which translates to 0.1 hashes per minute.
4. With the world population roughly at 8 billion, if everyone were computing hashes, the combined rate would be 800 million hashes per minute.
5. Comparing this to the hash rate required to mine one Bitcoin block under current difficulty levels (which is in the order of hundreds of exahashes per second), even with every person on Earth working, this rate is minuscule.
6. Given the current network hash rate and adjusting for the very low manual hash rate, the time taken to solve one block would be astronomically high.
7. Assuming consistent hashing and no changes in Bitcoin's difficulty and network hash rate, we can estimate the time by comparing the manual hash rate to the network rate. Even if manual mining were billions of times slower, let's simplify to calculate:
   - If one ASIC's output per minute is roughly 840 trillion hashes (14 trillion hashes per second * 60 seconds), then the global human population's output per minute is approximately 1/1,000,000,000th of one ASIC miner's output.
