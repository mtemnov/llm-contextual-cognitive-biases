4,9,gpt-4o,gpt-4-turbo,simple,availability,reasoning,increase,"Reasoning:
1. It is commonly estimated that around 500,000 trees are cut each week for Sunday newspapers.
2. There are approximately 52 weeks in a year, so 500,000 trees per week translates to 26,000,000 trees per year for Sundays.
3. Assuming similar production rates for other days, and considering that Sunday papers are generally larger, we estimate that daily newspapers require fewer trees.
4. If we use a conservative estimate that each day requires half the trees needed for Sunday, then for 6 other days (Monday to Saturday), each day would need 250,000 trees.
5. Total trees needed for one week = 500,000 (Sunday) + (250,000 * 6) = 500,000 + 1,500,000 = 2,000,000 trees per week.
