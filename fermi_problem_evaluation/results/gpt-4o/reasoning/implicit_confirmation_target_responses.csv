1. Assume widespread tobacco use started around the 16th century.
2. Estimate the global average number of smokers over the centuries as populations grew.
3. Assume an average smoker consumes 1 pack (20 cigarettes) per day.
4. Use an estimated global population and smoking rates for each century.

Example assumptions:
- 16th century: 50 million people, 1% smokers = 500,000 smokers
- 17th century: 100 million people, 2% smokers = 2 million smokers
- 18th century: 200 million people, 5% smokers = 10 million smokers
- 19th century: 1 billion people, 10% smokers = 100 million smokers
- 20th century: 2.5 billion people, 20% smokers = 500 million smokers
- 21st century: 7.5 billion people, 20% smokers = 1.5 billion smokers

Total cigarettes per smoker per year: 20 cigarettes/day * 365 days = 7,300

Estimate cigarettes smoked per century:
- 16th century: 500,000 * 7,300 * 100 = 36.5 billion
- 17th century: 2 million * 7,300 * 100 = 146 billion
- 18th century: 10 million * 7,300 * 100 = 7.3 trillion
- 19th century: 100 million * 7,300 * 100 = 73 trillion
- 20th century: 500 million * 7,300 * 100 = 365 trillion
- 21st century (so far): 1.5 billion * 7,300 * 23 (years) = 251.85 trillion

- The difficulty of these puzzles adjusts so that one block is mined roughly every 10 minutes by the entire Bitcoin network.
- Pen and paper calculations are extremely slow compared to electronic computations.
- Assume a human can perform one hash calculation by hand every 10 minutes (and this is a generous estimate).
- Current mining hardware performs trillions of hash calculations per second (terahashes per second, TH/s).

- We can estimate the hashing rate of a human as 1 hash every 10 minutes.
- There are approximately 8 billion people on Earth.
