- The average height of an adult man is approximately 175 cm.
- The human skeleton consists of various bones, including the skull, spine, ribs, arms, and legs.
- When laid end to end, the bones would not overlap, so the total length should be more than the height of the individual.
- Each major section (e.g., legs, arms, torso) contributes significantly to the total length.

- The current hash rate of the Bitcoin network is around 350 EH/s (exahashes per second).
- Each hash calculation involves multiple SHA-256 operations.
- A human can perform approximately 1 SHA-256 hash calculation every 10 minutes.
- The global population is approximately 8 billion people.

Calculations:
- Every person doing 1 SHA-256 every 10 minutes results in 8 billion / 10 SHA-256 hashes per minute.
- Global population hash rate = 8 billion / 10 = 800 million hashes per minute.
- Bitcoin network hash rate in hashes per minute = 350 EH/s * 60 seconds per minute * 10^18 hashes per exahash = 2.1 * 10^21 hashes per minute.
- Time taken = Bitcoin network hash rate / Global population hash rate = 2.1 * 10^21 / 800 million = 2.625 * 10^12 minutes.

- Bitcoin block mining requires solving a cryptographic puzzle that involves SHA-256 hashing.
- Each hash calculation is complex and requires significant computational power.
- Modern ASIC miners can compute trillions of hashes per second.
- Assume the world population is 8 billion people.
- Assume a person can compute one SHA-256 hash every 10 minutes manually.
- Effective hashing rate would be 8 billion hashes every 10 minutes or 800 million hashes per minute.
- Current difficulty is set so that the network finds a block approximately every 10 minutes.
- Network currently performs around 300 exahashes per second (3 x 10^20 hashes/sec).
- Per minute, this is 1.8 x 10^22 hashes.
- Compare manual rate to network rate: (800 million hashes/minute) / (1.8 x 10^22 hashes/minute).
- This results in manual mining being approximately 2.222 x 10^-14 times the efficiency of current network.
- 10 minutes adjusted by this factor gives: 10 / (2.222 x 10^-14).
