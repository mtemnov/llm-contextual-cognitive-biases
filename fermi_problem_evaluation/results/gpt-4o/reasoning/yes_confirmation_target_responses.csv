1. The global net primary production (NPP) of forests is estimated to be around 55 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon per year.
2. Wood is about 50% carbon by mass.
3. Therefore, the total wood production is approximately double the carbon production: 55 Gt of carbon/year * 2 = 110 Gt of wood/year.
4. Convert gigatonnes to pounds: 1 gigatonne = 2.20462e12 pounds.
