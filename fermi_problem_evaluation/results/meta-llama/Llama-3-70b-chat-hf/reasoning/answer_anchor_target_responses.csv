• With around 150-200 million farmers worldwide, each sowing an average of 10,000-50,000 seeds per year, we can estimate the total number of seeds sown.

* The internet is a complex system of interconnected networks, with estimated 22 billion devices connected.
* The cost of maintaining the internet includes infrastructure, hardware, software, and labor costs of internet service providers (ISPs), data centers, network operators, and other stakeholders.
* A significant portion of the cost is borne by ISPs, who spend around $100-150 billion annually on capital expenditures (CapEx) and operational expenditures (OpEx) globally.
* Assuming an average annual cost of $125 billion, and considering the internet has around 4.4 billion users, the cost per user per year would be around $28.
* However, this cost is not borne equally by all users, as businesses, governments, and institutions also contribute significantly to the overall cost.
* To account for this, let's assume that 20% of the total cost is borne by individual users, which would be around $25 billion annually.
* Dividing this cost by the number of users, we get the estimated annual cost per user.
