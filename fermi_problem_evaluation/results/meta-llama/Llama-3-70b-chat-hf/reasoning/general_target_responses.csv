4. The Bitcoin network's target is to mine a block every 10 minutes, which translates to a hash rate of 180,000,000,000,000,000 hashes per 10 minutes (calculated from the Bitcoin's difficulty adjustment algorithm).
5. Divide the target hash rate by the total hash rate of the world population to get the time it would take to mine a block.

1. The world population is approximately 7.9 billion people.
2. Assuming each person performs one hash operation per second (an extremely optimistic estimate).
3. The Bitcoin network's target is to mine a block every 10 minutes, which corresponds to a hash rate of 1 block / 10 minutes = 0.1 blocks per minute.
4. To find the total number of hash operations required to mine a block, we can use the Bitcoin network's total hash rate, which is around 120-140 EH/s. Let's use 130 EH/s as a rough estimate.
5. Convert the total hash rate from EH/s to hash operations per minute: 130,000,000,000,000,000 hash operations / second ≈ 7,800,000,000,000,000 hash operations / minute.
6. Divide the total number of hash operations per minute by the number of people performing hash operations per minute: 7,800,000,000,000,000 hash operations / minute ÷ 7,900,000,000 people = approximately 987,340 hash operations per person per minute.
7. Since each person performs one hash operation per second, it would take each person approximately 987,340 seconds or around 16,456 minutes to perform the required number of hash operations to mine a block.
8. Since there are 7.9 billion people, the combined effort would mine a block in approximately 1/7,900,000,000 of the time it takes one person: 16,456 minutes ÷ 7,900,000,000 ≈ 0.00208 minutes.

4. Convert the total hash rate to exa hashes per second (EH/s): 7,900,000,000 hashes/second ≈ 0.0079 EH/s.
5. The Bitcoin network's current difficulty requires a hash rate of around 120 EH/s to mine a block in 10 minutes.
6. Scale the 10-minute block time according to the ratio of the world population's hash rate to the network's required hash rate.
