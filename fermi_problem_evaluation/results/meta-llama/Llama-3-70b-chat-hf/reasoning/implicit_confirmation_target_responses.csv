2. 1 ton is equal to 1,000 kg, so the total MSW generation in kg is 292,400,000 tons * 1,000 kg/ton = 292,400,000,000 kg.
3. This includes both domestic and commercial waste; however, since domestic waste is a significant portion, we can use this estimate as a proxy.

• The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reported that in 2019, the total municipal solid waste (MSW) generated in the United States was approximately 292.4 million tons.
• This number includes both domestic and commercial waste, but a significant portion comes from domestic sources (e.g., households, residential buildings).
• Assuming a rough estimate of 70% of MSW comes from domestic sources, we can allocate a substantial portion of the total waste to domestic trash.

1. According to the EPA, the average American generates about 4.4 pounds of trash per day.
2. With a population of approximately 331 million people in the US (as of 2020), the total daily trash generation would be 4.4 pounds/person/day * 331 million people = 1.45 billion pounds/day.
3. There are 365 days in a year, so the total yearly trash generation would be 1.45 billion pounds/day * 365 days/year = 529.25 billion pounds/year.
4. 1 pound is equal to approximately 0.453592 kilograms, so the total yearly trash generation in kilograms would be 529.25 billion pounds/year * 0.453592 kg/pound = 240.24 billion kg/year.
