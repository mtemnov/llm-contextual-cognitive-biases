• Estimating the total number of professional football games played throughout history is challenging, but we can make an educated guess.
• There are approximately 200-250 professional football leagues worldwide, with an average of 10-15 teams per league.
• Assuming each team plays 20-30 games per season, and considering the sport's popularity has grown over time, let's estimate an average of 25 games per team per season.
• With around 2,500 teams (200-250 leagues \* 10-15 teams per league), and an average of 25 games per team per season, we can estimate around 62,500 games per season.
• Professional football has been played for approximately 150 years, with the first official league, the Football League, established in 1888.
• Assuming an average of 50,000 games per year (accounting for growth and varying league sizes), we can estimate around 7,500,000 games played throughout history.
• The average number of goals scored per game is around 2.5-3.0, based on historical data from various leagues.

1. Annual global wood production is around 13 billion cubic meters (source: FAO).
2. Average wood density is around 0.5-0.8 g/cm³, taking an average of 0.65 g/cm³.
3. 1 cubic meter is equal to 1000 liters, and 1 liter is equal to 1000 grams, so 1 cubic meter is equal to 1,000,000 grams.
4. Therefore, total annual wood production in grams is 13,000,000,000 cubic meters * 0.65 g/cm³ * 1,000,000 grams/cubic meter ≈ 8,450,000,000,000,000 grams.

6. 1 pound is equal to 453.592 grams, so daily wood production in pounds is 23,150,000,000,000 grams / 453.592 grams/pound ≈ 51,050,000,000 pounds per day.

4. Estimate the density of wood: around 0.5-0.8 g/cm³, with an average of 0.65 g/cm³.
5. Calculate the mass of new wood grown per hectare per day: 0.00958 cubic meters per hectare per day * 0.65 g/cm³ * 1000 kg/m³ = approximately 6.24 kg per hectare per day.
